  "project": "JWST High-z Galaxy Excess: A Semi-Analytic Model with Redshift-Dependent Star Formation Efficiency",
  "research_question": "Can a physically motivated, redshift-dependent star formation efficiency prescription in a lightweight semi-analytic model reproduce the excess of UV-luminous galaxies at z>10 observed by JWST?",
  "hypothesis": "At high redshift (z>10), reduced stellar/SN feedback efficiency due to low metallicity and enhanced gas accretion rates lead to elevated star formation efficiency, producing more UV-luminous galaxies than predicted by standard constant-SFE models.",
  "success_criteria": [
    "The modified SAM UV luminosity function at z=10-14 matches JWST observations within 1-sigma error bars at the bright end (M_UV < -20)",
    "The model simultaneously reproduces the known UV LF at z=4-8 (no degradation of low-z fit)",
    "The SFE enhancement has a clear physical motivation (metallicity-dependent feedback weakening)",
    "Chi-squared improvement of >50% over baseline constant-SFE model at z>10"

    {"id": 3, "name": "proposed_method", "status": "completed", "summary": "Added z-dependent SFE boost [g(z)=1+beta*(z-z_piv)] and metallicity-modulated feedback weakening. Optimized via differential evolution: beta=0.785, z_piv=7.74, f_fb_weak=0.137, Z_crit=0.130."},
